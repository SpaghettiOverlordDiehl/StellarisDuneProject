Alright, so.
Steam release branch will be empty until we have released a branch onto Steam, and will be updated with the most recent version of the mod.
Our individual branches will be used for ourselves (Obviously)
Test branch is used to merge the two branches, figure out the bugs, fix the bugs, then redistribute to both personal branches from the merged one. *IMPORTANT* DO NOT CONTINUE WORKING ON PERSONAL BRANCH WHILE TEST BRANCH IS BEING UPDATED, PROGRESS WILL BE WIPED UPON REDISTRIBUTION!\
Inital branch serves as the inital deposit/Backup of the previous steam release.
