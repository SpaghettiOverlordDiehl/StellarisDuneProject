# dunezro.2.name: "Arrival at Arrakis"
# dunezro.2.desc: "We have arrived at Arrakis. The vast deposits of spice melange on the planet will make us rich or attract many enemies. But first we need to decide on how to collect the Zro. Should we try to make Dune the better place by giving out water to population and making deals with smugglers or should we rule as we fit exploiting every possible credit from population? There is always a middle ground - we can just keep the order on the planet as it is."

Their culture is focused around religion and survival - the most valuable resource to them is water. \n\nWe currently don't know the exact numbers or the locations of where they live so they might be a really small group. Some of them are married to people living in cities. Should we try contacting them?"
